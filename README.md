# About - technical
This repository contains the implementation of a small city builder game called "Buda Builder". The project is developed using OpenGL and C++. Terrain generation utilizes the Perlin noise algorithm, and building collisions are detected using AABBs.

# About - game
Players can navigate the camera using the "WASD" keys and select from various building types to place on the terrain. As time progresses, the sky color changes dynamically, and the water waves realistically.
